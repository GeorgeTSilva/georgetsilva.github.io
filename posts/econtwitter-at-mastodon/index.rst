.. description: Economists are migrating to Mastodon instance EconTwitter as an alternative to Twitter.
.. type: text

This past week I witnessed a mass migration of economists in the wilds of social media. Over 4,700 individuals moved to `EconTwitter <https://econtwitter.net/>`_, a Mastodon instance set up by Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham. This online community is just getting started, but I'm excited by its potential. There are already over 21,000 posts!

Mastodon is a free and open-sourced microblogging service that is similar to Twitter. The main difference is hosted by self-hosted independent instances (servers) that can interoperate as a federated social network. 

You can join me on EconTwitter by following `@georgetsilva@econtwitter.net <https://econtwitter.net/web/@georgetsilva>`_.
