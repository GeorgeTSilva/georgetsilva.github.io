I'm a resource economist with a passion for data analysis and 
technology. Over the past few years, I've watch the development of the 
data science field and I've become increasingly interested in the 
subject. Data science seems to complement the tools economists use to 
understand how humans allocate scarce resources. While econometrics 
tries to fit data to economic models, data science can help fill in the 
gaps between economic theories and may even help discover new economic 
models. My goal is master these new techniques of data science and share 
them with you here on this site. 

I will be primarily working in the Python programming language. While 
I've used R in the past, I've come to discover that the general 
flexibility and scalability of Python will likely make it the dominate 
platform for conducting data science. Therefore, I've spent the past 
year learning Python. One of my favorite resources for getting up to 
speed with Python has been the book, *Automate the Boring Stuff with 
Python* by Al Sweigart. After figuring out the basics of Python 
programming, I've moved on to Pandas, Folium, Requests, Selenium, 
Matplotlib, NLTK, Numpy, and Scikit-learn. It seems like I find a new 
interesting Python libraries every week now. This is quite a shift from 
my traditional economic toolset of Excel, SAS, SQL, and ArcGIS to get my 
work done. 

Ultimately, I hope to blend my background in economics with the new 
techniques in data science to create some whole new methods for using 
data to learn about the world. Maybe I'll become a Data EconoScientist 
along the way.
